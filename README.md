# Fasm-compiler-interpreter
This is my compiler/interpreter. It is built in fasm (also called flat). The lexer does not currently produce actual lexemes but instead acts more as a parser using the abstract syntax tree (not 100%). This project is intended to use the fastest possbile systems and so will not soon be self-hosting but instead use many variations of different systems such as stack machines and abts (abstract syntax trees).
